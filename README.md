### Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects using ReactJS and some using the NextJS library. Also spending time using and teaching Ruby on Rails!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning better ReactJS practices, hoping to start working with TypeScript soon!
